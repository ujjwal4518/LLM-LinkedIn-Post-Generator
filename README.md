LLM-Based LinkedIn Post Generator (No GPT Models)
=================================================

🧠 Objective
------------
This project is a simple web app that generates professional and human-like LinkedIn posts using a locally hosted open-source language model.

⚠️ This project does NOT use GPT models (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) and works without any external APIs.

✅ The model used is: TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0 (open-source, small enough to run on laptops).


🛠️ Tech Stack
-------------
- Python 3.10+
- Flask (for web app)
- Hugging Face Transformers
- TinyLlama (1.1B) model for text generation
